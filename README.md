# **E-COMMERCE WEBSITE**

### Amazon like E-Commerce site built using `React`, `Material UI`, `Context API`, `Stripe API` and `Firebase`.
### It uses `Firestore` to track cart details, `Firebase Hosting` and `Cloud Functions` for Stripe payments.
> **Note**: _Now, you can't make any payments because Stripe requires a Firebase Blaze plan whereas mine is a Spark plan_
